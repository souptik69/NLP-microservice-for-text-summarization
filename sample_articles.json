According to the group, failure to comply with this demand will result in collective community action to \u201cresist these injustices\u201d.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \"Our investigation has revealed that this parasitic action by EKODISCO is not backed by the National Electricity Regulation Commission (NERC) or any extant law or regulation.\n\n\u201cAs such, we categorically reject these fraudulent bills and state unequivocally that the community will not pay. The actions of EKODISCO are extortionist and exploitative and cannot stand.\n\n\"It is particularly disheartening to note that despite multiple national newspaper publications revealing that the Federal Government of Nigeria has provided over N21 billion for the provision of free prepaid meters, which EKODISCO has benefited from, residents of Ajegunle, particularly those subjected to this double billing, have yet to receive these meters, rather the DISCOs force consumers to pay over N110,000 for one-phase prepaid meter and over N215,000 for three-phase prepaid meter.\n\n\"We view this move by EKODISCO as an illegal strategy to increase the debt burden of Ajegunle residents, thereby creating a pretext for the company to impose fictitious conditions before granting free prepaid meters. This is an unacceptable exploitation of the people, and we shall resist it.\n\n\"We, therefore, call on the EKODISCO management, Apapa district, and all marketers involved to immediately recall these fraudulent bills and refrain from disconnecting any consumer based on the fraudulent bills. Failure to comply with this demand will result in collective community action to resist these injustices.\u201d\n\n\"The APM remains committed to defending the rights and welfare of the people of Ajegunle and will continue to hold EKODISCO accountable for any actions that undermine the well-being of our community people,\" the statement added.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T14:01:03+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://saharareporters.com/2024/08/15/lagos-community-accuses-eko-electricity-distribution-company-ekedc-multiple-billings", "source": {"domain": "saharareporters.com", "location": null}}, {"uri": "f321ea0563d542bfab0d21b5caba1f1b", "title": "San Onofre inspection notes two low-level violations", "body": "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission popped in for a regular look-see at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in June, concluding that decommissioning work was pretty much on schedule and radiological work areas were \u201cadequately controlled.\u201d\n\nSouthern California Edison self-reported two low-level violations: The first involving a \u201cfailure to ensure a package for shipment was leakproof and properly closed and sealed to prevent release of radioactive content as required by U.S. Department of Transportation regulations,\u201d and the second involving a \u201cfailure to ensure, by examination or appropriate tests, that the packaging for the Unit 2 pressurizer (main function: to keep reactor\u2019s coolant below boiling) was proper for the contents being shipped as required by DOT regulations.\u201d\n\nThe NRC said those were low-level violations \u2014 Severity Level IV (less serious but of more-than-minor concern; Levels I and II can be considered the bad boys). Since Edison and its decommissioning contractor placed the two deficiencies into a \u201ccorrective action program,\u201d and since the safety significance was low, and since the violations \u201cwere non-repetitive and not willful,\u201d Edison was not cited, according to the inspection report.\n\nA Unit 2 pressurizer leaked water at a railyard in San Bernardino County while being shipped offsite for disposal, Edison spokesman Jeff Monford said.\n\nIt leaked about one drop every two minutes, was stopped and sealed, and the deck of the rail car was cleaned. Radiological surveys found no detectable radioactivity above background levels on or around the component, and there was no threat to public health or the environment, Monford said.\n\nThe second component, the pressurizer from Unit 3, did not leak; it was stationed at the same railyard while en route to the offsite disposal facility. Both components were returned to San Onofre on July 4 and will remain on site \u201cwhile an evaluation is being conducted to learn from this event and avoid recurrence with similar components.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no date for wrapping up that evaluation just yet.\n\nThe NRC inspectors reviewed the plant\u2019s radioactive waste treatment, effluent and environmental monitoring; remedial and final surveys; fire protection program; and solid radioactive waste management in addition to the transportation of radioactive materials.\n\nIt was a routine, announced inspection, and Edison et al. \u201cwere found to be conducting activities in accordance with site procedures, license requirements, and applicable NRC regulations\u201d with those two exceptions.\n\nCleanup of the reactor cavities was slightly behind the original schedule, but \u201ccommensurate with the challenges encountered.\u201d Non-radioactive buildings were being demolished during the inspection, and \u201cinspectors observed that good industrial safety controls were in place including use of water cannons to suppress the dust created by demolition activities.\u201d\n\nOf interest: Procedural and radiological controls for the environmental monitoring program, including the planned drain down of the Unit 3 reactor cavity, were in place, and \u201cgood health physics and operational preplanning controls were in place to support the drain down,\u201d the NRC said. (The release of wastewater from the plant, happening regularly for decades, remains a concern for some.)\n\nEdison is also doing ongoing radiological surveys of the north and south ocean-sidebluffs, which hadn\u2019t been included in the historical site assessment, \u201cto demonstrate that the areas had not been impacted by previous plant operations.\u201d Surface scans for gamma radiation and soil sampling for radionuclides were done properly and found no detectable plant-related radionuclides, the report and Monford said.\n\nThose results support Edison\u2019s classification of the bluffs as a \u201cnon-impacted area\u201d in its complex License Termination Plan.\n\nEdison reviewed the NRC\u2019s findings with its decommissioning contractor and workers, \u201cand we remain committed, in our oversight role, to ensuring safety and adherence to all regulatory requirements,\u201d Monford said.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T14:00:33+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/2024/08/15/san-onofre-inspection-notes-two-low-level-violations/", "source": {"domain": "pasadenastarnews.com", "location": {"country": "us", "state": "CA", "city": "Pasadena", "coordinates": {"lat": 34.1476507, "lon": -118.144155}}}}, {"uri": "5f0b21d2bee44f628dce19befb0a0a36", "title": "Top News on August 15: Independence Day celebrations, Ola\u2019s e-bike launch, Kolkata doctor rape-murder row and more", "body": "India marked 78 years of Independence on Thursday as outrage over the rape and murder of a Kolkata doctor continued across the country.

After the allegations surfaced and he was demonitised by YouTube, banned from Twitch, and even cut off by his own studio, he took a vacation and even considered hanging up streaming.\n\nHowever, at the end of last month, he teased a comeback with a photo of him playing chess while the audience plays checkers (bizzarely hinting at this being part of some long game), and only yesterday, deleted the tweet in which he admitted to inappropriately messaging a minor\u2014of course, that hasn't erased the myriad screenshots people took.\n\nNow, he's bragging about how much he's enjoying his vacation, despite the backlash to the behaviour he himself admitted to that led to his hiatus to begin with; \"Vacation is just too good right now.

Instead, it will patch the sewer line and leave the water main untouched.\n\nIf either fails, millions of gallons of water could spill out and pressure could be lost, even putting the city\u2019s water supply at risk.\n\nOver the last week, finger-pointing between the city and the San Antonio Water System has expanded to include the city\u2019s contractor, Sundt Construction, which says SAWS or its subcontractor, HDR Engineering, failed to do sufficient pre-construction work on the project. SAWS says Sundt was responsible for that work.\n\nSAWS\u2019 board of trustees learned last Tuesday that the original replacement project has basically been abandoned so that the street can be closed in time for tens of thousand of visitors to descend on the Alamodome.\n\nTrustees balked over the city\u2019s request that SAWS sign a memorandum of understanding agreeing to pay half the street repair costs if the mains break in the next decade.\n\nThe replacement of the mains was originally part of the city\u2019s 2012 bond program. VIA\u2019s hopes to run street cars along South Alamo first delayed the project, although those plans never came to fruition. The main replacement was then pushed to the 2017 bond program, delayed again by both the pandemic and construction at Hemisfair\u2019s Civic Park, city officials said.\n\nWhen work finally started in 2021, the project\u2019s price tag was estimated at $36.6 million. No one can say at this point what the final cost will be.\n\nCity officials told the San Antonio Report on Monday that SAWS\u2019 failure to properly identify where its underground chilled water lines are on South Alamo Street \u201ccontributed significantly to the project\u2019s delays.\u201d\n\nSAWS refuted that charge by pointing to pre-construction documents that the utility says show \u201cthe contractor,\u201d or Sundt, was responsible for this investigative work.\n\nWhen Sundt crews started construction in December 2021 \u2014 a month after being selected for the project \u2014 they hit existing chilled water lines in the spot they where they were going in to add more, Sundt\u2019s senior vice president and corporate strategic business officer John Carlson said.\n\n\u201cThat shows me someone didn\u2019t do their job during the design phase,\u201d Carlson said, adding that Sundt was not hired as the designer in this case, just as the builder. \u201cEverything snowballed from that.\u201d\n\nAlong with the city\u2019s prolonged renovations of the St. Mary\u2019s Strip, the Broadway Corridor and Zona Cultural, the South Alamo Street project delays have just added to downtown construction headaches. Those frustrations have recently pushed small business owners to get more involved in upcoming city elections in an effort to hold the city accountable.\n\nIn response to constituents\u2019 complaints, Councilwoman Sukh Kaur (D1) filed a council request earlier this summer to revise the city\u2019s construction process. Namely, it asks that the city states ahead of a project which party is responsible for identifying the existing underground infrastructure.\n\nThat request is set to go before the council\u2019s governance committee Friday.\n\nIn older parts of downtown, maps showing where the city\u2019s utility lines lie are often outdated \u2014 meaning pre-construction work includes verifying where they actually are, said Assistant City Manager John Peterek.\n\nThis can sometimes involve a process called \u201cpotholing,\u201d or the drilling of exploratory holes to properly locate underground utilities. The city and Sundt allege SAWS or its design subcontractor, HDR Engineering, didn\u2019t do enough of this type of investigative work prior to the first day of construction, meaning the designs the contractor was using were incorrect.\n\n\u201cSAWS owns all water and wastewater lines in San Antonio, and it is their responsibility to identify and manage their part of any capital improvement project involving utilities,\u201d Peterek told the San Antonio Report. \u201cOn South Alamo, SAWS did not accurately locate their chilled water lines during the project\u2019s design.\u201d\n\nSAWS President and CEO Robert Puente on Tuesday pointed to language in the pre-construction bid that \u201cthe contractor shall verify the exact location of underground utilities \u2026 1-2 weeks prior to construction whether shown on plans or not.\u201d He says this shows that the responsibility lies with Sundt.\n\nPuente did acknowledge that the utility\u2019s subcontractor HDR Engineering \u201chad some deficiencies in their design,\u201d and so is \u201cpartially responsible\u201d \u2014 though less so than the primary contractor, Sundt.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carlson said those sections of the bid documents are simply referring to Sundt\u2019s responsibility to call the state\u2019s \u201cCall Before You Dig\u201d service and get the above ground infrastructure paint marked, which he said Sundt did. Carlson reiterated that the \u201cdesigner\u201d \u2014 whether SAWS or HDR Engineering in this case \u2014 is the party responsible for the pre-construction investigative underground work under the law.\n\nSAWS chief operating officer Andrea Beymer acknowledged that there probably should be clearer guidelines for all parties on joint construction work moving forward. \u201cAs we look at certain projects, particularly in the downtown area, identifying those that we need to do more subsurface investigation work\u201d will be important, she said.\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s at fault, Puente told the San Antonio Report that SAWS is now working with HDR Engineering, as well as the city, to find a way forward.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Kaur\u2019s council request will be sufficient to avoid this type of confusion in the future. She told the San Antonio Report Tuesday that the city needs more clarity about the roles and responsibilities each entity takes on within these long, complicated projects. Doing so could help prevent delays that have bedeviled residents and small businesses alike, Kaur said.\n\nFor now, construction on the South Alamo project continues in order to meet a deadline imposed by a basketball tournament, with additional costs to the taxpayer remaining unclear.\n\nThe Final Four could generate an economic impact of as much as $220 million, say boosters.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T14:00:00+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://sanantonioreport.org/final-four-south-alamo-san-antonio-water-main-replacement-city-response/", "source": {"domain": "sanantonioreport.org", "location": null}}, {"uri": "e0baccca683e4dc0bd6c371334e6e81f", "title": "Tropical Storm Ernesto Drenches Puerto Rico, Leaves Half the Island Without Power", "body": "Half of Puerto Rico was left dark Wednesday after Tropical Storm Ernesto downed power lines and dumped more than 10 inches of rain on some parts of the island.

The overall energy storage capacity of the project hasn\u2019t been revealed, but PHES technology would typically have a discharge duration of 6-20 hours, meaning anywhere from 4.8GWh to 16GWh in this case.\n\nColbun is also deploying battery energy storage systems (BESS) in Chile, with the first of some 800MW coming online in late 2022.\n\nIn a related development, Colbun entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with high-density PHES technology company RheEnergise last year to explore the potential of a smaller system in Chile using RheEnergise\u2019s technology.\n\nYou can read the Spanish-language EIA documents from the Chilean government pertaining to the Paposo project here.

This move includes shutting down 186 stores and comes off the back of the company's bankruptcy filing last year. The company confirmed that this change is a part of Rite Aid's efforts to operate efficiently while meeting the needs of our customers, communities, associates, and overall business. As per ClickOnDetroit, Rite Aid stated, \"While we have had to make difficult business decisions over the past several months to improve our business and optimize our retail footprint, we are committed to becoming financially and operationally healthy.\"\n\nThe phasing out of Rite Aid\u2019s presence in Michigan is slated to be completed by the end of September. The forthcoming closure of its Waterford distribution center, scheduled tomorrow, will lead to the abrupt end of employment for 191 workers, as disclosed to journalists by the company in June. A review by Bridge Michigan of bankruptcy court documents indicates that, in less than a year, at least 230 Rite Aid stores in Michigan will have closed. As Bridge Michigan has learned, these closures are part of a larger contraction within the pharmacy market, which has seen a significant reduction in both corporate and independent pharmacies due to various market pressures.\n\nOn the subject of employment for those affected, John Cakmakci, president of Local 951 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, told Bridge Michigan that many pharmacy employees have been able to find new positions with relative ease. \"For those that want to continue employment, it's an easy job market to find one,\" Cakmakci pointed out, as per Bridge Michigan. This news comes during a time when pharmacies are already contending with financial struggles, such as diminishing reimbursements and the increased take of revenues by benefits managers.\n\nThe transition away from brick-and-mortar pharmacies like Rite Aid may exacerbate the problem for particular groups, such as older residents or those with complex health conditions. Eric Roath, director of government affairs of the Michigan Pharmacists Association, emphasized this point, drawing attention to the fact that some patients \"require a higher level of service than mail order and online solutions typically provide.\" He also noted pharmacies' role in offering vaccines and tests for ailments such as flu and COVID, as cited by Bridge Michigan.\n\nFor Rite Aid customers in Michigan, the imminent closings translate to the need to swiftly secure new establishments for their prescriptions. Rite Aid is advising customers to verify where their prescriptions will be transferred and to request any necessary changes to ensure continuity of care. With \"Store Closing\" signs becoming increasingly visible on the stores\u2019 facades, end-of-an-era sentiments are evident amongst the community. As reported by MLive, customers should communicate with Rite Aid to manage their prescriptions ahead of the scheduled closures.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:55:29+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://hoodline.com/2024/08/rite-aid-to-shut-all-michigan-stores-amid-ongoing-financial-struggles/", "source": {"domain": "hoodline.com", "location": null}}, {"uri": "7d0e7176feb8400bb1dfdd2d0f20720c", "title": "Google monopoly ruling: where the tech giant goes from here", "body": "A US judge has found that Google is a monopoly and has used this dominance to reinforce its market position.\n\nThis ruling, which is subject to appeal, brings the US regulator close to the European Commission in its approach to tech giants such as Google, Meta, and Amazon. Regulators now agree that the nature of these companies\u2019 business means that the market ends up becoming a monopoly dominated by one massive company.\n\nIt has thus become the job of the state to protect consumers from tech giants consolidating their dominance. As a company, 80% of Alphabet\u2019s (Google\u2019s owner) revenue, comes from advertising, a total of US$146 billion (\u00a3114 billion) in 2021. Almost everything the company does must be understood through this lens.\n\nThe main source of Google\u2019s advertising income derives from its 90% market share of the market for general search engines, one of the oldest and most important services on the internet.\n\nTo provide users with answers ranging from the best recipe for an apple pie to a recommendation for a new vacuum cleaner, Google first gathers information about every page available on the Internet. Then, it uses its database of websites, the keywords used for search, what other people typically liked as an answer to similar queries, but also everything it knows about you, to rank possible answers.\n\nBusinesses then pay for the right for their own text to be prominently displayed alongside genuine search results. A higher quality of search results means more customers, which makes it easier to attract advertisers. It also means the advert can be tailored to consumer tastes and is therefore more valuable to advertisers.\n\nWhile research has shown the actual return on investment to businesses from digital advertising is unclear, and sometimes even negative, search advertising remains in high demand. It constitutes 66% of Google\u2019s revenue and growth in the past decade.\n\nOther services such as Google Maps and YouTube also contribute. For a start they also generate advertising revenue. But they also provide even more information to help tailor search ads. This includes how much time a user spends on a page, what they click on, whether they react positively or negatively to a result, where they are physically and how they travelled there.\n\nAll this information about you is stored and serves a single purpose. It builds a highly detailed profile of you as a consumer that has enormous value to advertisers looking to personalise ads directly for you.\n\nIn order to gather all this valuable data, it\u2019s vital for Google that it retains that market dominance. Google reportedly spends more than US$26 billion each year to ensure it comes up as the default search engine for the highest number of users.\n\nOn any Android or Apple phone, the default is Google search representing a market share of 94.9%. Google is also the default on almost every web browser. And research shows that even if the cost of switching to another search engine is small, the default position leads to a vicious circle. When consumers stick to the default, it means the possible alternative does not have enough consumer data to offer a high quality search, or to be attractive to advertisers.\n\nGoogle spends US$8.4 billion a year to operate its search engine \u2013 on top of the fortune it already spends on ensuring it remains the default search engine. Today, Microsoft\u2019s Bing is the only search engine truly competing with Google by spending billions to index the whole world wide web.\n\nAt some point, Microsoft offered to initially share 100% of its Bing revenue with Apple to secure the default instead of Google. Apple still said no: the amount was less than what Google could offer. Google is not necessarily much better as a search engine. On Microsoft Edge, the only browser where Bing comes as a default, 80% of users stick to Bing. Apple also reportedly has no interest in buying Bing from Microsoft.\n\nGoogle search is simply so big and so good at making money from advertisers that it is very costly to move away from it. In many ways, the market for advertising on search engines is actually very close to legal monopolies such as water distribution or rail tracks, where the cost of setting up the infrastructure are so big that there is simply no space for more than one company.\n\nIn a statement, Kent Walker, president, Global Affairs at Google, said: \u201cThis decision recognises that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make it easily available. We appreciate the Court\u2019s finding that Google is \u2018the industry\u2019s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users,\u2019 that Google \u2018has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices,\u2019 \u2018has continued to innovate in search\u2019 and that \u2018Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google\u2019s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google\u2019s to be superior.\u2019\n\n\"Given this, and that people are increasingly looking for information in more and more ways, we plan to appeal. As this process continues, we will remain focused on making products that people find helpful and easy to use.\u201d\n\nIn the recent US case, the judge has not yet announced how it wants Google to stop using its monopoly.\n\nSome rivals want to split Google\u2019s advertising business from its search engine. Another solution would be to force Google to share the data it gathers. Doing so could improve search results for everyone.\n\nJust like it makes little sense to have competing pipes bringing water to your home, it makes little economic sense for several firms to pay billions to gather the exact same information. This is why some groups favour having Google share its data.\n\nExisting attempts at setting precise rules for big tech, however, sometimes have no obvious benefits for consumers. The European Commission, for instance, wanted Alphabet to stop sending Google search results about locations directly to Google Maps. But, according to one analysis, when Google removed the clickable maps from its search results, along with the Google Maps reference, there was only a modest increase in searches for other map services. Visits to Google Maps, meanwhile, changed very little.\n\nSo, despite all the legal moves to introduce more competition into this market, huge questions thus remain as to what practical steps regulators can take without making the consumer experience even worse.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

In August 2020, private equity firm Laurel Oak Capital Partners of Boston announced the acquisition of RRTC Holdings Inc., which included Roadrunner Temperature Controlled and A&A Express. Roadrunner Temperature Controlled later was renamed AA Temperature Controlled, with headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. However, it\u2019s unclear if the company\u2019s main headquarters in Omaha, which has 303 drivers and the same number of power units, will remain open. An employee who answered the phone at the Omaha office said that Cannon and Dan Lathrop, vice president of operations at A&A Express, were in a meeting and were the only ones who could speak about the current situation at the refrigerated company. A public information specialist with the Nebraska Department of Labor told FreightWaves that as of publication time Thursday that a WARN notice had not been filed in the state. Under the WARN Act, employers with more than 100 workers at a location must give authorities 60-day advance notice of a planned closure and job layoffs. \u201cThe outcome was not reasonably foreseeable, but due to these unexpected circumstances, the company can no longer sustain the operations,\u201d Cannon said about the South Dakota facility. As of publication, neither Cannon nor Lathrop had responded to FreightWaves\u2019 repeated requests for comment. Laurel Oak Capital also did not return phone calls about the Brandon facility closure. In 1945, Vince Anderson founded the former family-owned livestock hauling company, Anderson Trucking of Walnut Grove, Minnesota, before it became A&A Express. The carrier was acquired as a subsidiary of Roadrunner in November 2012. A&A Express hauled meat and produce throughout the U.S. with its fleet of refrigerated trailers. One A&A Express driver, who goes by the username Bayou_Swamp_Rat shared the news of the company\u2019s closure on TikTok on Aug. 9. The driver said he was in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and had delivered at a Target distribution center when he heard the news of the closure. He planned to deadhead about 295 miles to the yard in Brandon to turn in his truck. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time at any company that I\u2019ve ever been to where you actually feel like a person and not a number,\u201d said Bayou_Swamp_Rat on TikTok. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to give them a driver number or a truck number when you call in.

All content on NWZonline and in the NWZ news app will then be available to you without restriction.\n\nBockhorn - The Old Brickworks is located between Zetel and Bockhorn - where people today go to the swimming pool or play mini golf in the immediate vicinity. The brickworks building has existed at this location for over 100 years and it should stay that way. At least there are new plans for the site, which is managed by the Manfred Ende company from Westerstede. Gravel, mountains of sand, building rubble, road building materials, general cargo and machines are stored in the areas around the old building. Construction rubble will now also be recycled and sand and topsoil prepared on the company premises. The company also wants to set up ground storage in the existing buildings. This now requires a change in the land use and development plan.\n\nSo it was finally the turn of those responsible for public affairs to express their concerns, after which the plans had to be adjusted again. The engineering firm Thalen Consult from Neuch\u00e2tel presented the plans to the municipality's last construction committee. However, there are no fundamental changes to the 6.2 hectare company premises. But the border overlaps with the public bicycle path along the jungle road. \u201cPart of the cycle path runs on private property, but we have included it in the public traffic zone,\u201d explains Constantin Block from Thalen Consult. The Lower Nature Conservation Authority also reported. \u201cAlthough there is a compensation surplus because there are water bodies and biotopes to the west, the landscape should fundamentally be taken into account when weighing up,\u201d Block explains. The planners were therefore denied the surplus. \u201cIt's always the same thing with the landscape. When planning, we always assumed that the brickworks had existed at the location long enough.\u201d\n\nA decision on the plans should now be made soon because the components for the new 380 kV high-voltage line are also to be stored on the site of the old brickworks - known from the Tennet project \u201cWilhelmshaven2 to Conneforde\u201d. The line will run locally in the Bockhorn bottleneck above Urwaldstrasse. It is also planned that earth from the earthworks for the power line will be temporarily stored on the brickworks site.\n\nFrom the archive: Still no solution for the old brickworks in Bockhorn\n\nAlso read: Neuch\u00e2tel's primeval forest is spared from deforestation", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:52:56+00:00", "lang": "de", "url": "https://www.nwzonline.de/friesland/bauschutt-recyceln-in-bockhorn-plaene-fuer-alte-ziegelei-vorgestellt_a_4,1,2184942268.html", "source": {"domain": "nwzonline.de", "location": null}}, {"uri": "9d65154a51d74a32a6b74795a0b48038", "title": "Families of 3 people killed in 2023 file lawsuit against Southside apartment complex", "body": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2013 Nearly one year after a 3-year-old girl and two men were shot and killed at a Southside apartment complex, their families are suing the complex\u2019s owner and property management company.\n\nAttorneys filed three wrongful death lawsuits against JTB Apartments, JTB AC Skinner, The Inland Real Estate Group and Inland Private Capital Corporation.\n\nThe lawsuits claim there was not enough security to keep the victims safe.\n\nAttorneys are seeking $50,000 for each of the victim\u2019s families.\n\nThree-year-old Kae\u2019Lynn Matthews, 23-year-old Jaquann Mitchell and 24-year-old Keonte Johnson were shot and killed in the common area of the JTB Apartments property on Sept. 23, 2023.\n\nRELATED | \u2018Didn\u2019t live her life:\u2019 Family of 3-year-old fatally shot at JTB Apartments pleading for answers in her death\n\nIn the lawsuits, attorneys accuse JTB apartments of not having proper security gates to protect residents and visitors.\n\nThey say the complex did not have adequate surveillance cameras or lighting throughout the property.\n\nAttorneys also claim the complex did not hire enough security guards to patrol and monitor the apartment complex.\n\nThe lawsuits also accuse the complex and surrounding area of having \u201chigh crime.\u201d\n\nThey claim the area experienced \u201cshootings, assaults, armed batteries and robberies\u201d leading up to the deadly triple shooting.\n\nAll three of the victims\u2019 families are planning to hold a news conference this Thursday at 10:30 a.m. At the DoubleTree By Hilton Hotel on Riverplace Boulevard on the city\u2019s Southbank.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office says four people in total were shot at the complex when police say five people showed up there to possibly sell or buy a dog, before police say an argument led to the shooting.\n\nPolice say a fourth person was shot but survived.\n\nMORE | Family broken by death of 3-year-old shot at Southside apartment calls for community to \u2018do better\u2019\n\nNo one has been arrested in this case so far.\n\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office said they are still looking for two men they say were seen leaving the scene of the shooting in a \u201cdark-colored\u201d car.\n\nNews4JAX has called the apartment complex for comment on this lawsuit, and we have not heard back.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:52:26.312000+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2024/08/15/families-of-3-people-killed-in-2023-file-lawsuit-against-southside-apartment-complex/", "source": {"domain": "news4jax.com", "paywall": false, "location": {"country": "us", "state": "FL", "county": "Duval County", "city": "Jacksonville", "coordinates": {"lat": 30.3321838, "lon": -81.655651}}}}, {"uri": "7f5bad116fc2421292d72f5ca1cb7405", "title": "Clarksville School District Investigates After Child Found Alone on Bus", "body": "A six-year-old student, identified as Connor, experienced distress when he was inadvertently left asleep on a Clarksville-Montgomery County Schools (CMCSS) bus on Tuesday morning, as reported by Clarksville Now.

(Archive image) \u00a9 The company, headquartered in Hanover, had its role during the National Socialist era scientifically examined and published the results on Tuesday. There was already a huge outcry in 2019 when Verena Bahlsen (31), great-granddaughter of the company's founder Hermann Bahlsen (1859-1919) and shareholder, claimed that forced laborers at Bahlsen during the Nazi dictatorship were treated \"well\" and paid \"just the same\". , like German employees. The family business, founded in 1889, reacted immediately and announced an independent review of its own company history. At that time, the family business from Lower Saxony stated that around 200 forced laborers were employed in production between 1943 and 1945. However, these numbers were not correct, as the study that has now been published reveals.\n\nBahlsen: \"Regret that we didn't face this truth sooner!\"\n\nBetween 1940 and 1945, Bahlsen used over 800 forced laborers to produce baked goods. (Symbolic image) \u00a9 According to the report published on Tuesday by a committee of experts at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, over 800 forced laborers were used at Bahlsen from 1940 onwards. In a press release on Tuesday, the traditional company thanked the scientists for the \u201cmeticulous work\u201d and emphasized that the events were \u201cinexcusable.\u201d \"The truth about the events at that time is uncomfortable and painful. We deeply regret the injustice that happened to these people at Bahlsen. We also regret that we did not face this difficult truth sooner,\" it says. New technology is intended to convert CO2 into something useful: Saxon start-up pulls the teeth of climate killers. According to Bahlsen, the \u201cmain drive\u201d of the management at the time was to keep the company running even under the Nazi regime. Their ancestors therefore \u201ctook advantage\u201d of the inhumane system - with \u201cbad\u201d consequences.

Google not only curtails our ability to generate advertising dollars, but it also uses our news content to drive web traffic to its search site.\n\nEssentially, they\u2019re putting the work product of our journalists on their site and selling advertising with it. And reaping the profits. Google made more than $300 billion last year, most of it from advertising it sells using content it did not create or pay for.\n\nMeanwhile, local journalism is struggling to survive. California alone has lost over 100 newspapers in the last decade, cutting off a flow of information critical for the survival of local democracy. Fortunately, state lawmakers are trying to at least partially correct this imbalance.\n\nTwo bills are working their way through the Legislature this month. The most promising, AB 886, authored by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, D-Oakland, would require online platforms such as Google and Facebook to share the money they make off local news organizations\u2019 articles.\n\nThe bill would require the journalism organizations to spend at least 70% of funds through the California Journalism Preservation Act on journalists and support staff. In other words, Google would have to stop undermining local journalism and start helping fund it.\n\nIt\u2019s not a new idea. Similar laws have been passed in Canada and Australia, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in newsrooms.\n\nOf course, the devil is in the details, and the biggest detail remains how much Google would be required to compensate news organizations for the privilege of using their content. The amount is currently under negotiation between legislative leaders and Google. The big question is whether the company will strike a deal, like they have in other countries, or roll the dice and go to arbitration.\n\nMeanwhile, the bill, now in its second year in the Legislature, has passed the Assembly, but must still pass a key Senate Appropriations Committee this week. Before the end of the month, it must pass the full Senate and go back to the Assembly for concurrence in amendments.\n\nAnother bill, SB 1327, by state Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, takes a different approach to the same problem. It would tax large tech firms on the user data they collect for advertising purposes, and then use the tax revenues to support news publications.\n\nClearly change is needed.

Since December of last year, the company has not provided any electric motorcycles to its showrooms. This has led to severe consequences, including legal actions from dealers and disgruntled employees.\n\nDealers across India have filed a complaint against Tork Motors, leading to the shutdown of its showroom on Law College Road, Pune. They allege that their investments have gone to waste due to the company\u2019s failure to deliver vehicles. In response, they have lodged a police complaint in Pimpri, seeking the return of their invested money.\n\nAdditionally, customers are experiencing difficulties, as spare parts and services for the company\u2019s electric motorcycles, particularly the Kratos model, are unavailable. This has led to many motorcycles being rendered unusable, forcing owners to consider scrapping them.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder and CEO, Kapil Shelke, is at the center of the complaints. Assistant Police Inspector Kiran Pathare from Pimpri-Chinchwad confirmed that an investigation is underway, though details are being kept confidential. Action is expected within the next week.\n\nMoreover, Tork Motors has terminated several employees since July 31, and these workers have not received their salaries for the past seven months. Despite this, the company has assured that employees will receive relieving letters within the \u201cscheduled time.\u201d\n\nAs Tork Motors grapples with these issues, the company\u2019s future remains uncertain, with both dealers and customers anxiously awaiting resolution.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:46:31+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://www.mypunepulse.com/pune-tork-motors-faces-legal-action-as-dealers-and-employees-protest/", "source": {"domain": "mypunepulse.com", "location": null}}, {"uri": "c2c1c2a0566141bfb862ab033d27a6c8", "title": "Recall alert: 653K Trader Joe\u2019s mango tangerine candles recalled", "body": "Trader Joe\u2019s has recalled about 653,000 candles that could pose a burn hazard.\n\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission said the flame in the mango tangerine scented candles can spread from the wick to the wax and cause a flame that is bigger than expected.\n\nThe candles have SKU 56879 printed on the bottom of the tin container.

Despite these warnings, Ford reports that there are still about 374,300 vehicles with these faulty inflators on U.S. roads, with a global total of 765,600. Mazda adds another 83,000 vehicles to that count. In response, both automakers, alongside the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, have issued a renewed do-not-drive advisory for the affected vehicles. This issue is highly dangerous. In 2022, NHTSA confirmed the death of a driver in a 2006 Ford Ranger due to a ruptured airbag inflator, which sent shrapnel flying into the cabin. This incident brought the total number of fatalities related to these faulty inflators in the U.S. to 23.\n\nThe age of these vehicles increases the likelihood that a part within the airbag could explode during a crash, potentially sending sharp metal fragments into the vehicle\u2019s occupants, and leading to serious injury or death. The affected Ford models span from the 2004-2012 model years, including vehicles like the 2005-2014 Mustang and the 2007-2011 Ranger. Mazda\u2019s warning covers models from 2003-2015, such as the Mazda6 and CX-9. Ford has made extensive efforts to alert owners, including more than 121 million outreach attempts in the U.S. This includes letters, emails, phone calls, and even visits to customer homes. Both automakers are offering free towing, mobile repair services, and loaner vehicles to encourage owners to get these dangerous parts replaced.

Together we can ensure our platform remains a hub for empowering ideas committed to fighting for a sustainable, healthy, and compassionate world. Please support us in keeping our mission strong.\n\nSpaceX has come under scrutiny for environmental violations linked to its operations in Boca Chica, Texas. The aerospace company, led by Elon Musk, has been found discharging pollutants into local water bodies, a breach of regulations that could impact its ambitious space exploration goals.\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a notice of violation to SpaceX, following a series of complaints about its water deluge system at the Starbase facility. This system, crucial for cooling and sound suppression during rocket launches, has reportedly been operated without the necessary state authorization. Such violations were first noted by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Region 6 office, signaling a breach of the Clean Water Act.\n\nInvestigative records obtained by CNBC reveal that the TCEQ\u2019s office in Harlingen received 14 complaints regarding the environmental impact of the facility\u2019s deluge system. The concerns escalated with findings that SpaceX discharged industrial wastewater without a permit on multiple occasions between March and July 2024.\n\nSpaceX\u2019s development of the Starship, aimed for lunar and Martian missions, has necessitated frequent launches and landings at the Boca Chica site. However, environmental oversights have led to significant legal and regulatory challenges. The unauthorized use of the water deluge system not only violated state and federal laws but also risked further civil penalties and criminal charges against the company.\n\nIn a recent statement on the social media platform X, SpaceX indicated that despite the violations, regulatory bodies had not demanded a halt to their operations. The company has continued its launch activities, even as it navigates the complexities of compliance.\n\nThe environmental implications of SpaceX\u2019s activities have attracted significant attention, given the sensitive ecological zones surrounding the Boca Chica site. A notable incident occurred during Starship\u2019s first test flight in April 2023 when an explosion scattered debris across a crucial habitat for endangered species, sparking legal actions from environmental groups.\n\nWith the FAA yet to clear SpaceX for further test flights and ongoing investigations into the wastewater discharges, the company faces a precarious path forward. It must balance its pioneering technological endeavors with stringent environmental responsibilities to minimize its footprint on the local ecosystem and comply with regulatory standards. As the situation develops, SpaceX\u2019s handling of these environmental challenges will be crucial in determining its future operational capabilities at the Boca Chica launch site.\n\nBeing publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high-quality content.

There\u2019s the chipped wood in the front door, the bathtub that feels like it\u2019s sinking into the ground and the occasional decaying rat in the wall, she said.\n\nBut Bastin loves her apartment and, even more than the unit itself, she cares deeply for her neighbors and the community they\u2019ve built.\n\nBastin, however, has to pack up her things and leave after being priced out of her building.\n\nThe courtyard building at 1740 W. North Shore Ave. changed ownership earlier this year, and the new landlord is increasing Bastin\u2019s rent by 20 percent and introducing new fees on utilities, internet and pets.\n\nUnable to accommodate the price hikes, Bastin and some of her neighbors will have to leave once their leases are up. But first, they\u2019ll have to clean a lot. Tenants were then given an extensive cleaning list to tackle before moving \u2014 with hundreds of dollars in fines to be levied if their units are not properly cleaned.\n\nThe ones who will stay at the building, meanwhile, are frustrated by the financial strain it\u2019s going to put on their lives, multiple tenants said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only building in Rogers Park seeing these changes. The Far North Side neighborhood has struggled for years with displacement and gentrification driving up the cost of living.\n\nThe area including Rogers Park, Edgewater and Uptown saw a 12.5 percent decline in the amount of apartments affordable for low-income renters between 2012 and 2021, according to a 2023 study by the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. That is the third biggest drop in affordable apartments of any area of the city during that period, trailing only Logan Square and Avondale (15.3 percent decrease in affordable apartments) and West Town/Near West Side (14.6 percent decrease).\n\nThe Far North Side neighborhoods also saw a 9.5 percent increase in the amount of low-income renters living in unaffordable apartments over the same period, one of the biggest jumps in number of rent-burdened residents of any neighborhood, according to the study.\n\nBastin wants to stay in Rogers Park, but there aren\u2019t many options that fit her budget of $1,250, she said. She works full-time earning enough to live comfortably \u2014 or so she thought.\n\n\u201cThe rental market is insane,\u201d she said. \u201cYou either find something that is just completely unlivable \u2014 like, \u2018Why does this have a half stove?\u2019 \u2014 or they\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s a one bedroom,\u2019 but it\u2019s really just like an alcove and there\u2019s not even a door.\u201d\n\nAnnual rent increases are an understandable part of being a renter, but when they\u2019re this steep and come without any major improvements to the apartment, Bastin and her neighbors said they can\u2019t willingly accept it.\n\n\u201cTo me, they\u2019re price gouging because they can,\u201d one of Bastin\u2019s neighbors said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they have no compassion towards people. It\u2019s just all about money.\u201d\n\nWhen Bastin first moved into the apartment, her rent was around $950, she said. Her rent increased $25 a year under the building\u2019s previous owners.\n\nThis spring, Bastin and her neighbors received a notice from building owner DLG Management that the complex had been purchased by Casey Capital, a real estate company founded in 2020. Casey Capital bought the building for $4 million, property records show.\n\nA few months later, Bastin received word from Casey Capital about her apartment\u2019s rent going forward. If she renewed her lease, her rent would go from $1,125 to $1,350 per month, according to a copy of the lease renewal shared with Block Club.\n\nCasey Capital also introduced new fees: an $85 monthly utility fee covering water, heat, sewer and trash removal, and pet rent of $25 a month per pet, according to the lease renewal. These were utilities that were previously included in tenants\u2019 rent, Bastin and her neighbors said.\n\nBeginning in October, the company is also instituting a required, bulk internet service for an additional $40 a month.\n\nIf Bastin resigned, the total cost of her same apartment going forward would be $1,475. The company is waiving an initial year of pet rent for current tenants, according to the lease renewal \u2014 which would cost another $75 a month for Bastin, since she has two dogs and a cat.\n\nIn their lease offering to Bastin, Casey Capital acknowledged the price change was \u201csteep\u201d and said \u201csmaller and more predictable\u201d rent increases \u2014 about 3-5 percent \u2014 could be expected going forward. To offset the steep increase, Casey Capital offered tenants a 20-month lease that would bypass one year\u2019s worth of rent hikes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be forced out of your home when I have a perfectly good apartment that I clearly have been able to afford and maintain,\u201d Bastin said.\n\nBastin isn\u2019t aware if any major repairs or renovations are being planned for her apartment, she said.\n\n\u201cI feel like letting somebody come in and charge [hundreds] more for the same unit \u2014 that\u2019s not inflation, that\u2019s just greed,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of Bastin\u2019s neighbors are going to absorb the increased cost of their apartments, but they aren\u2019t happy about it.\n\nOne woman said she\u2019s anxious about the cost increase she\u2019ll get with her renewal offer after hearing about what her neighbors were getting. The neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous over fear of retribution from management, said she\u2019s lived in the building for a few years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to move,\u201d she said. \u201cI moved around a bunch my whole life, so this is the first place I ever lived longer than two years.\u201d\n\nThe woman has been unable to work in the past because she has autism and struggles with autistic burn-out, but the worry about being financially burdened has her contemplating going back to work regardless of the effects it may have on her mental health, she said.\n\nHer husband is also now looking for a higher-paying job, but she knows many of her neighbors aren\u2019t in the same position to do so, she said.\n\n\u201cThey know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said of the company. \u201cThey know they\u2019re forcing people out.\u201d\n\nAnother neighbor who\u2019s lived in the building for nearly 20 years is still figuring out whether she\u2019ll be able to stay in her apartment. This neighbor also asked not to be named while her lease renewal was up in the air.\n\nThe woman has a fixed income and a housing voucher, so dramatic changes in rent and associated fees are difficult to manage, she said. She was also frustrated by the required internet service through the building, because it\u2019s a provider she\u2019s had issues with in the past.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too much, especially when you have good tenants that have been in the building for years and years, and you see that they keep up your property,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all about the almighty dollar.\u201d\n\nAside from the financial strain people are facing, \u201cit\u2019s heartbreaking\u201d to see neighbors they\u2019ve grown close to have to move, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like family here in the building, everyone looks out for each other,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe displacement these tenants are experiencing is a microcosm for housing issues seen across the neighborhood and the city, particularly with the loss of naturally occurring affordable housing, said Arieh Venick, a community organizer with the nonprofit ONE Northside.\n\nMany of Chicago\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing (that is, units that are not required by the city to be earmarked as affordable) is in buildings that tend to be older, owned by smaller landlords and may not be in top condition, Venick said.\n\nCompanies buy these buildings and \u201cslap a fresh coat of paint on and try to rent it to a college student or a young urban professional who\u2019s looking for cheaper housing in a hip neighborhood,\u201d he said.\n\nHistorically, Rogers Park has had many such buildings. Diversity of building ownership, like mom-and-pop landlords or neighbors who own the three-flat they live in and rent the other two units, has helped provide affordable places to stay, said Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).\n\nBut in recent years, building turnover in the neighborhood has increased. And \u201cwith the concentration of wealth and capital,\u201d large management companies are the only players in the market who can buy these buildings, the alderwoman said, speaking anecdotally.\n\nWhen companies take ownership and raise rents, it can also have a ripple effect on other buildings, Hadden said. In a neighborhood where 75 percent of residents are renters, the loss of affordability is having a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on the neighborhood, Hadden said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge in the 49th Ward right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause rents are going up at some of these properties that are changing hands. The other thing that you see is properties that aren\u2019t changing hands, those landlords are taking advantage to also raise their rents just because.\u201d\n\nSituations like what\u2019s happening at Bastin\u2019s building \u201care one of the top situations fueling a growing homeless and housing precarious population in the city,\u201d Venick said.\n\nTenants are required to be given 60-120 days notice of a rent increase, but for people living paycheck to paycheck, it isn\u2019t enough time to find an alternative, he said.\n\n\u201cI think Rogers Park is really emblematic about some of the stuff we\u2019re seeing across the city, and we\u2019ll continue to see on the North Side if these landlords are not able to be brought to heel, and more tenant protections and organizations don\u2019t pop up,\u201d Venick said.\n\nForming tenants\u2019 unions is one of the best ways to combat exploitative practices by landlords, according to Venick. There are limited ways in which local government can address the situation, Hadden said.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s currently a ban on rent control in Chicago that was made at the state level, meaning Hadden and her colleagues can\u2019t do much on their own, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very supportive of rent control,\u201d the alderwoman said. \u201cUnfortunately, with so many thing around real estate, we find ourselves at an impasse.\u201d\n\nAside from rent control, Venick said the city should also pass policies like the Just Cause Ordinance \u2014 which supporters say would protect tenants from no-cause evictions \u2014 and allocate more money toward the creation of public, affordable housing.\n\n\u2018Are They Just Insane With Power?\u2019\n\nShortly after Bastin let Casey Capital know she wouldn\u2019t be resigning, she was emailed a two-page list of move-out instructions and the fees she\u2019d be charged if the place wasn\u2019t up to snuff.\n\nThis included things like $15 for each light fixture she didn\u2019t clean, $25 if the smoke detector batteries needed replacing and $25 if the area under the microwave was left dirty, according to a copy of the document shared with Block Club. There\u2019s also a $35-$75 fee if she didn\u2019t mow the lawn \u2014 which confused her, as she doesn\u2019t have a lawn to mow.\n\nThe listing for Bastin\u2019s apartment is already on Casey Capital\u2019s website.\n\nRent is advertised as $1,350, but the total cost of the apartment with a one-time $50 application fee, a $750 move-in fee and the monthly utility and internet fee of $125, it comes to $1,542 a month, according to the listing.\n\nIf a new tenant had pets, like Bastin does, it\u2019s an additional one-time fee of $250 with $25 monthly pet rent per dog or cat.\n\nAs Bastin looks for new apartments, the prospect of staying in Rogers Park \u2014 where she\u2019s lived for 14 years \u2014 is unclear.\n\n\u201cYou just wonder like, what are these landlords doing? Are they just insane with power? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bastin said.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:43:00+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/08/15/rogers-park-tenants-forced-out-by-big-rent-hike-as-area-faces-affordability-crisis-its-heartbreaking/", "source": {"domain": "blockclubchicago.org", "location": null}}, {"uri": "2de933fb85e548b482a1e46fbfb1e8bc", "title": "Modehersteller wollen weiter in Bangladesch produzieren", "body": "Cologne \u00b7 The political situation in Bangladesh is unstable. However, clothing manufacturers are not initially planning any consequences. This also applies to the textile discounter Kik.\n\nThe fashion association GermanFashion has not yet seen any major impact on the industry following the recent unrest in Bangladesh. When asked, it cannot be confirmed that orders will be canceled and relocated to other countries. On the whole, the situation on site has calmed down again. Production is stable and a backlog in the port is the only hurdle. The textile discounter Kik is also not planning to relocate production. \u201cBangladesh is and remains a particularly important production country for us,\u201d said a spokesman. According to the company, Kik's supplier network includes around 100 textile factories in Bangladesh. The Swedish fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) informed the German Press Agency that all of its suppliers' factories in Bangladesh are currently open. The company has not changed its long-term strategy in the country and continues to assess the situation daily, a spokesman said. The fashion retailers Zara and Hugo Boss, which also produce clothing in Bangladesh, did not initially respond to a dpa request. The vice president of GermanFashion, Justus Lebek, said: They are monitoring the situation closely and are expecting slight delays in deadlines, \"but the end consumer will not notice anything about them.\" During the corona pandemic, production in China stood still for months, but it still didn't happen There were bottlenecks, it was said. Many companies have therefore recently positioned themselves more broadly. For example, closer production locations in North Africa have become more important. According to the fashion association, the manufacturers in question have maintained close relationships with their production facilities in Bangladesh that have developed over the years. August is therefore not a strong production month for medium-sized fashion companies. The autumn and winter goods are being delivered and the next production cycle is just starting. GermanFashion represents 350 companies from the industry. After China, Bangladesh is the most important importing country for clothing for the fashion industry in Europe and Germany. There are almost 4,000 textile factories there that employ more than four million people, mostly female workers. According to the Federal Statistical Office, goods worth a total of 7.1 billion euros were imported from Bangladesh to Germany in 2023.

A replacement bus service was set up for passengers at affected stops.\n\nThanks to the bus, 80-year-old still manages to get to the doctor\n\nOne of the commuters affected is Uwe Baas: \u201cI wanted to go into the city and the tram wasn\u2019t coming. There was no information on the platform about the replacement service and why the train wasn't coming. \u201cIt can be done better,\u201d says Baas. The 80-year-old was on the way to the doctor when he was surprised by the total breakdown of the tram. \u201cOther passengers then informed me about the alternative service and I was able to attend my doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d the pensioner continues.\n\nBianca Baron and Jens Becker were also surprised by the replacement traffic: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know in advance and were surprised,\u201d said Baron. Since there are no display boards at their stop in Toitenwinkel, the friends had to find out about the alternative transport connections themselves. \u201cOnce we had all the information, it worked,\u201d says Jens Becker. \u201cSome of the buses were very full,\u201d remembers Becker. But he understands that: \u201cA bus is of course much smaller than a tram. Not that many people can take part,\u201d says Becker.\n\nThe RSAG also knows about the full buses: \u201cWe had to set up an emergency timetable in a very short time. Since we were only able to rely on free buses and drivers, the individual replacement connections can get a little fuller,\u201d says RSAG press spokeswoman Beate Langner.\n\n\u201cWe found out about the slump tonight and are working hard to get the route ready for use again,\u201d said Langner. During the night, a cyclist noticed the sagging of the cycle path next to the rails, whereupon he informed the police. \u201cWe then decided to let the trains travel over the affected area with a speed limit,\u201d explains Langner.\n\nAfter a few crossings, the full extent of the subsidence became apparent and rail traffic was interrupted. According to OZ information, the sagging in the trains was clearly noticeable. However, there was no damage to people or trains.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the subsidence was construction work by the municipal utilities,\u201d explains Langner.

To do this, the tram route must first be repaired.\n\n\u201cWe cannot currently say when operations will be restored,\u201d said Langner.

Each house here will not only have its own landscaped territory but also its original design.\n\nThe residential area \"A101 Vsevolozhsk\" is being built in the Southern microdistrict of the city. The project envisions the integration of residential buildings into the natural landscape while preserving and recreating the natural environment. This approach will also be applied to the landscaping of the adjacent territories. The courtyards of the new residential area are planned to feature diverse spaces with natural elements, with each courtyard differing from the others. The unique designs of the courtyards will add extra individuality to each house, while the use of various natural motifs will help avoid monotony in the landscape and surrounding environment.\n\nFor example, one courtyard, named \"Forest Bird,\" will be equipped with a playground designed like a nest and birdhouses. The second house will have its own \"Rabbit Hole\" \u2013 a courtyard with a trampoline shaped like a rabbit burrow, which will become a favorite spot for local children. Residents of two other houses will stroll and relax in courtyards designed according to their names \"Honey Bee\" and \"Bellflower.\" The first will feature play elements resembling a beehive and honeycombs, while the other will have tactile play areas and structures shaped like flowers.\n\nThis landscaping concept will not only make the adjacent spaces more aesthetically appealing but will also promote the development of cognitive and play skills in children. The interests of adult residents have also been taken into account. Cozy spots for sports, relaxation, and meetings with neighbors will be created in the courtyards.\n\nParticular attention in the project is given to safety and functionality. Each courtyard in the \"A101 Vsevolozhsk\" residential complex will be fenced and equipped with modern lighting systems, anti-slip surfaces, and wide, comfortable paths for walking and cycling.\n\nThe concept of landscaping also applies the principle of climate comfort. For this purpose, playgrounds will be built in sunny areas, and each courtyard will have covered gazebos where people can shelter from the wind and rain. Sports and yoga areas will also be covered with awnings for the same reasons. To ensure natural wind protection, plans include preserving the existing trees on the site and planting new ones, focusing on plants that are traditional for the local climate.\n\nThe landscaping of the new residential area is designed to cater to the interests of all age groups. Various public functional areas will be created on its territory: for quiet and active recreation, sports activities, educational spaces, entertainment areas, and even a new eco-trail running through the pine forest. The zoning is thoughtfully planned to avoid rigid separation and provide each resident with the opportunity to choose activities based on their interests and mood, which will foster good neighborly relations.\n\n\"The architectural concept of the project embodies modern ideas for the collaboration of urban environments with nature, which will create a comfortable and harmonious space for active and healthy living. In the landscaping of the 'A101 Vsevolozhsk' residential area, the priority is to maximize the preservation of the existing trees and shrubs on the site. The natural environment will be recreated in the courtyards and around them: plants that traditionally grow in this area have been chosen for greening. The shrubs and plants are selected to ensure almost continuous blooming in the area from May to October, and the landscape in the courtyards will change with the seasons,\" says Bulat Mirzahanov, head of product development at A101 Group in St. Petersburg.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:42:28+00:00", "lang": "ru", "url": "https://www.fontanka.ru/2024/08/15/73963448/?erid%5C%5Cu003d2SDnjcJ3YZg=", "source": {"domain": "fontanka.ru", "location": null}}, {"uri": "de3319b99b21431bb345a18f809849f7", "title": "Mining in Canada: Court appoints receiver at Yukon site", "body": "A judge has granted an order appointing a receiver to take control of assets at a gold mine closed after a massive slide of cyanide-contaminated ore in June, Yukon\u2019s justice minister said.\n\n\n\n Tracy-Anne McPhee said in a statement Wednesday that the government had petitioned the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for the receiver after it lost confidence that Victoria Gold would take seriously the health, safety and environmental consequences of the failure at the Eagle Gold mine.\n\n\n\n McPhee said PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc. would administer the assets and liabilities formerly under the control of Victoria Gold at the direction of the territorial government and under the supervision of the court.\n\n\n\n \u201cImmediate action is required to respond to the heap leach failure and its consequences for the land, water, people and wildlife in the Traditional Territory of the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun,\u201d McPhee said.\n\n\n\n \u201cThe Government of Yukon is concerned that Victoria Gold Corp. does not possess the capacity itself and has failed to carry out the work that is required.\u201d\n\n\n\n The minister said Victoria Gold \u201chas failed to comply with several formal directions\u201d issued by the government, which \u201crequire specific measures to be undertaken to address human health and safety and environmental risks and impacts.\u201d\n\n\n\n On June 24 the heap-leach facility at Eagle Gold mine failed, causing a slide of cyanide-contaminated ore and releasing millions of litres of cyanide solution used in the gold extraction process.\n\n\n\n Yukon officials have said some water samples taken downstream have shown cyanide levels that \u201csignificantly exceed\u201d guidelines for aquatic life.\n\n\n\n Brendan Mulligan, a senior Yukon government scientist, told a briefing last week that \u201cclear evidence\u201d of groundwater contamination had also been found, though samples with the highest concentrations of cyanide were being \u201ccontained on site.\u201d\n\n\n\n Health officials have said that contamination does not impact drinking water.\n\n\n\n Both the territorial government and the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyak Dun filed applications in separate courts this week asking for a receiver to be appointed, something the company said in a statement it was opposing.\n\n\n\n Chief Dawna Hope told a news conference earlier Wednesday that the court action was the only way the First Nation could ensure that steps necessary to mitigate the disaster would be taken.\n\n\n\n She said Victoria Gold was failing to do what was needed to protect land and water from the cyanide.\n\n\n\n \u201cThis is unacceptable. Immediate steps are needed to address the millions of litres of toxic cyanide and other contaminants spreading from the mine site,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n \u201cEvery mitigation measure must be implemented to protect the lands, waters, fish, wildlife and the people impacted by this disaster. We have no confidence that Vic Gold is in a financially stable enough position to repair the environmental damages its failures have caused.\u201d\n\n\n\n McPhee said the territorial government has entered into an agreement with the receiver to advance the money required to undertake mitigation work, which will be treated as debt to be prioritized over others owed by Victoria Gold.\n\n\n\n At the First Nation\u2019s news conference, consultant Cord Hamilton estimated the cost of cleaning up the spill would be \u201csomething in the magnitude of order of $100 million\u201d on top of the cost of closing and remediating the mine.\n\n\n\n The Yukon government has previously said it has $104 million in bonds to cover remediation costs if the mine were to cease operations.\n\n\n\n Victoria Gold CEO John McConnell did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\n The mine is located about 400 kilometres north of Whitehorse, on the traditional territory of the Na-Cho Nyak Dun, which has called multiple times for Victoria Gold to be removed from managing the cleanup.\n\n\n\n Bill Slater, an environmental consultant working with the First Nation, told the news conference that there is not enough storage at the mine to contain the contamination and that water treatment has been ineffective.\n\n\n\n Earlier this month the Yukon government said 68 dead fish were found following a discharge of treated water from the site.\n\n\n\n \u201cThe lack of effective water treatment also means that existing storage on site is almost full. That includes the dynamic storage that they created by starting to pump solution back onto the heap again on July the 14th,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n \u201cIf not addressed, this lack of storage could lead to discharge of contaminated solution directly.\u201d\n\n\n\n The nation has previously called for a public inquiry to look into \u201cfailures that caused this catastrophe and ensure it never happens again.\u201d\n\n\n\n Slater said the government has ordered the company to build more groundwater collection wells, but that has not happened.\n\n\n\n The receiver is not Victoria Gold\u2019s only legal challenge.\n\n\n\n A Vancouver-based law firm has also filed a proposed securities class-action lawsuit against Victoria Gold, alleging the company made misleading statements regarding the safety and environmental practices at the mine, particularly concerning its heap leach facility.\n\n\n\n The territorial government\u2019s petition for a receiver was filed in Toronto, where Victoria Gold\u2019s corporate office is located, while the First Nation filed its application in Yukon Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n The First Nation\u2019s petition says the disaster is still unfolding and is impacting \u201cthe inherent, constitutional and treaty rights\u201d of the First Nation.\n\n\n\n It says the company\u2019s attempts to contain the cyanide have been inadequate and it has refused to comply with government orders.\n\n\n\n It says the company owes the First Nation more than $750,000 in royalty payments under the agreement that permits the mine to operate.\n\n\n\n Those allegations had not been heard in court before the decision on the territorial government\u2019s application was made.\n\n\n\n This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 14, 2024.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:42:07+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://newscontinue.com/mining-in-canada-court-appoints-receiver-at-yukon-site/", "source": {"domain": "newscontinue.com", "location": null}}, {"uri": "0ab8a0129b9146a8be2176a87eb57938", "title": "Sonos Slashes 100 Jobs After Mobile App Fiasco, May Bring Back Old App", "body": "Sonos has laid off approximately 100 of its employees, which is a mere 14 months after the beleaguered smart home audio company dropped roughly 150 of its 1,800 workforce. The timing of this comes after product delays plus the well-documented (and disastrous) rollout of the Sonos app , not to mention the company's earnings call last week, in which we're sure investors demanded accountability.According to a statement made by Sonos to a popular tech site, the once haloed company many likened to the Apple of audio products, has confirmed that it's entered a second round of layoffs following a similar one in 2023. In the statement, Patrick Spence, Sonos CEO, defended the move, saying that \"this action was a difficult, but necessary, measure to ensure continued, meaningful investment in Sonos\u2019 product roadmap while setting Sonos up for long term success.\"Spence went on to add that the app kerfuffle, and more importantly, the fix for it hasn't been affected by this shakeup. He declared that is \"our continued commitment to the app recovery and delighting our customers remains our priority and we are confident that today\u2019s actions will not impact our ability to deliver on that promise.\u201dLet's be clear, Spence made no direct mention that the layoffs are directly related to the app. Apparently, the 100 ex-employees came from various divisions, such as product engineering, marketing, software quality, and platform/infrastructure. However, it's not hard to see that the problematic app may have had something to do with the decision.In fact, Sonos has had to delay two new products to solve the app issue, which probably demonstrates how bad the situation is. In the last few months since Sonos rolled out a major app update, users have experienced widespread functionality and stability issues. Some experienced complete lockout from their libraries, while for others, the app completely broke their systems or messed with their settings.The reception for the app update has been so bad that throngs of long-time Sonos fans have either left the brand or boycotted it completely. As for repercussions for the company, fixing the app won't be cheap. Besides the delayed products, Spence told investors in the earnings call last week that getting the app up to snuff will be around $20 million to $30 million.

This old-fashioned national airline business model, which does not pay off on this kind of scale. Like we had Estonian Air, trying to go very wide, so that if there is an effect of scale, you can make a profit, but it takes a long time and a lot of investment. Basically, it is not a profit-making project, but the Latvians have the same argument that Estonia might have, that (without it) you wouldn't be able to fly out of this corner of the world,\" Peterson said.\n\nFinancially, however, airBaltic is in a bad way, as its high-interest bond issue showed, said Peterson, who has been the head of both Estonian Air and the Estonian Civil Aviation Administration (Lennuamet).\n\n\"The biggest negative signal actually was that they got a loan from the market at only 14.5 percent interest, which is still terrible these days. Basically, it shows that it's just a pyramid scheme in financial terms, and that at some point it just has to collapse,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson added that if it were up to him. he would change airBaltic's business model.\n\n\"This (legal) body has to be replaced by another one. It was a bit like what happened with Estonian Air when it did not get the state approval (from the European Commission) that the Latvians got,\" he said.\n\n\"I am not in favor of state capitalism, that the state should be the owner of something, but the thing about air connections is that you have to pay extra if you want to fly ten times a day to Europe. My estimate is that the Estonian state would have to pay something like 30 to 40 or even \u20ac50 million a year. But in this form, I would recommend that (airBaltic) be shut down, despite the fact that Estonian passengers also benefit from it,\" Peterson said, adding that airBaltic is such a mess in commercial terms that it will be difficult to close it down.\n\nAviation expert Sven Kukemelk told ERR that despite the huge losses, airBaltic is still a profitable project for the Latvian state, as tourism and jobs cover those losses many times over.\n\nAccording to Peterson, a comparison can be made with the planned Rail Baltica.\n\n\"We can make socio-economic calculations, and it's true that the development of the economy is very much dependent on it, but these are all forward-looking calculations. We don't know how the economy will do at all, or how many passengers will come, and a lot depends on their purchasing power. So, it's all apples and oranges. But to put it crudely \u2013 if they only got a 14.5 percent interest loan from the market, that shows that essentially the end is near,\" Peterson said.\n\nJan Palmer, the former head of Estonian Air and Nordica, told ERR that airBaltic's performance in the first half of 2024 was certainly poor, but it was also influenced by a number of external factors. They include problems with engine deliveries, recovery from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The potential for airBaltic to achieve success as an airline has not disappeared, he said.\n\n\"As an airline they have done a good job, but they have been affected by these external factors. And if you have a lot of planes that can't fly because of engine problems, well, it's one thing to have the repair costs that can be covered by insurance, but losing revenue would be a big problem for any airline,\" Palmer said.\n\nAccording to Palmer, the Latvian government may still find it is profitable to run a national airline.\n\n\"There may be socio-economic calculations behind it \u2013 if it is worth it for Latvia and the government is willing to support it because the associations will ensure that it is good for business and tourism, then from that perspective it may make sense,\" he said.\n\nFollow ERR News on Facebook and Twitter and never miss an update!", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:42:00+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://news.err.ee/1609425802/aviation-expert-airbaltic-has-to-collapse-financially-at-some-stage", "source": {"domain": "news.err.ee", "location": null}}, {"uri": "340064252d7846eb913d61846128237b", "title": "MHADA Lottery 2024: Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority Issues Warning After Fake Website Defrauds Mumbai Home Aspirants", "body": "Mumbai, August 15: The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) has issued a warning about a fake website, https://mhada.org, which is deceiving people seeking flats through the MHADA lottery 2024.

We support World Boxing. We will have no choice but to comply with the IOC.

Allegedly, the water is turned off without warning, there is no hot water at all, cold water barely flows. Officials confirm the problem. Lenoblvodokanal is training steeplejacks, but the solution to the problem is deeper.\n\nResidents of the village of Gavrilovo, Goncharovsky settlement, complained about long interruptions in water supply on August 15. They say the problem has been going on since August 7th. Either there is no resource, or the pressure is weak; it does not reach the upper floors of the houses. There is no hot water at all. Previously, there were supposedly problems too, but they were eliminated within 1-2 days.\n\n\u2013 If water appears, it is only cold and the pressure is barely enough to reach the second floors. There are no announcements, no water supplies either. We have to collect water at a pump a kilometer from the house; we carry it in cans. And soon the children will be ready for school and kindergarten,\u201d resident Natalya is indignant.\n\nThe head of the administration of the Gavrilovsky settlement, Andrei Simonov, confirmed to 47news that there is a problem. Water is periodically turned off in the entire village (there are more than a thousand residents, about 20 apartment buildings), last week, for example, for the whole day without warning. When there is a resource, it rises no higher than the 4th floor, \u201cit goes in a thin stream\u201d, since the pressure is weak. There are also 5-story buildings in the village.\n\n\u2013 Today there is another shutdown until 17:00, Lenoblvodokanal is changing the valves on the water supply line. But we managed to warn residents to stock up on water. When there are long outages, there is supply,\u201d Simonov said.\n\nAccording to him, the village has a whole range of network problems, including a water tower leaking at a height of about 20 meters since February. In his opinion, it is impossible to repair it, since the metal has broken through on the side where there is a slope and cannot be approached on an aerial platform; scaffolding must be erected.\n\nLenoblvodokanal explained to 47news that a leak was discovered at the water tower in the village of Gavrilovo, repairs are needed, after which the pressure in the network will improve. Work is currently being prepared and will begin soon.

Alarm at 5.20am, on air after 5.30am followed by the Today programme at 6.20am and then Good Morning Scotland on BBC Radio Scotland. It was all to discuss one thing: Asda, and what has gone wrong?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Asda have been losing share for over 10 years, and not just the past four. The supermarket has had three CEOs in the past 14 years, and only one, Sean Clarke, maintained market share. Under the other two Asda lost share.\n\nAsda have not had a CEO since Roger Burnley left three years ago. Roger has a lifetime of experience of multiple retailers. Since then Mohsin Issa has been at the helm \u2013 an experienced retailer, maybe, but with no experience of running a behemoth like Asda.\n\nRunning a multiple retailer will be like running an aircraft carrier: complicated, with lots of moving parts, people and processes. Running a petrol forecourt business, on the other hand, will be like running a speedboat: easier to manoeuvre, and with fewer moving parts. Just because you can drive a speedboat, it doesn\u2019t mean you have the skills to drive an aircraft carrier.\n\nIn the past two years Asda has rebranded Smart Price into Just Essentials (May 2022), launched its own loyalty card called Asda Rewards (August 2022), bought 132 Co-op forecourt sites (August 2023), bought 356 EG UK stores (August 2023) and relaunched Extra Special as Exceptional (now).\n\nAdd in Project Future \u2013 billed by Asda as Europe\u2019s largest IT transformation project (with an \u00a3800m spend) \u2013 and you have a lot of reasons to take your eye off the ball. Tesco and JS have done none of the above \u2013 they have had the same, experienced, CEOs and have a clear vision of what they are doing and where they are going. Asda have forgotten that retailing is about the basics of stores, price and availability.\n\nI was in an Asda yesterday and availability in chilled, produce and frozen was appalling. One of the chilled Special Offer cabinets was as bad as I have ever seen. It was a dumping ground with shelves that clearly needed a clean. The level of fill in Frozen was at an absolute minimum, which not only looks bad but is also very inefficient for the freezers! Frozen promotional ends were half empty.\n\nAsda have been busy recruiting big hitters for every possible senior role, some just starting, and others not until next year. A new CEO will be six months away at least, and even Stuart Rose has said there won\u2019t be one until next year.

According to the study, the ATR-72 entered an area with high ice formation, winds of 60 to 70 km/h and high, frozen clouds, with temperatures of around \u201340\u00b0C.\n\nAviation experts point out that problems with the functioning of the deicing system are among the possible causes that may have contributed to the accident.

However, on the same day, the plane continued to Porto Alegre, where maintenance once again pointed out that the plane's deicing system was inoperative, in addition to having a broken windshield wiper and a failure in the approach warning system. on soil.\n\nThe following day, before the twin-engine aircraft embarked for Congonhas, the report only indicated \u201cice restriction\u201d, which could indicate that the other systems had been repaired. On the same day, still in Congonhas, maintenance again warned of \u201cice restrictions \u2014 avoid sending to the South region\u201d.\n\nThe reports indicate that, four days later, the aircraft was in Congonhas with the deicing system and electrical generator inoperative. At the end of the same day, the ATR-72 underwent another inspection in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, which again showed that the de-icing system and the electrical generator were inoperative.\n\nAsked about the reports, Voepass told CNN that \u201cthis type of maintenance is part of the routine of all airlines in the world\u201d, and reinforced that it follows all operational protocols.\n\nThe Brazilian Air Force (FAB), the Federal Police and the Civil Police of S\u00e3o Paulo continue to investigate what led to the plane crash.

DP World Group\u2019s chairman and CEO, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, acknowledged that the Red Sea disruptions affected the firm\u2019s revenues.\n\n\u201cThe year 2024 has been marked by a deteriorating geopolitical environment and disruptions to global supply chains due to the Red Sea crisis,\u201d he said in a statement included in the results. \u201cWhile the near-term trading outlook remains uncertain due to macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, the resilient financial performance of the first half \u2026 positions us well to deliver stable full year adjusted\u201d profits.\n\nBin Sulayem did not elaborate on what specific effects the Houthi attacks had been having on DP World, a government-owned shipper that in recent years removed itself from the Nasdaq Dubai stock exchange.\n\nThe Houthis since November have been targeting shipping through the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The assaults have disrupted the $1 trillion of goods that flow annually through the region, while also sparking the most intense combat the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II.\n\nThe rebels maintain that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or the U.K. as part of a campaign they say seeks to force an end to the war. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict.\n\nShippers have begun going around the Cape of Good Hope off Southern Africa to avoid the Red Sea entirely.

The company\u2019s public relations manager, Lineo Thakhisi disclosed this in response to a Technext inquiry into the matter.\n\nTechnext had reported earlier that drivers were bashing the company for the unbelievably low fares.\n\nIn one order seen, a rider offered the sum of 2,000 naira for a trip from in to . As estimated on the app, the trip distance is 38.6 kilometres and is estimated to last an hour and two minutes. Yet, the fare is not enough for three litres of fuel.\n\nSimilarly, another ride from 146 Lagos-Epe Express Road to Ogba Magistrate Court, a distance of 37.8 kilometres with an estimated travel time of one hour and three minutes was ordered for 2,000 naira. Furthermore, another 30-kilometre trip that is expected to last an hour and 19 minutes was ordered for a fare of 4,000 naira. The cases are endless.\n\nResponding, the InDrive PR manager, Lineo said the company is aware of the issues and that they are rare, only affecting one per cent of trips.\n\n\u201c We are aware of recent reports about potential issues with trip orders and want to clarify that many of these concerns may stem from GPS glitches or passenger network issues. Given the scale of our operations, with hundreds of thousands of orders daily, these glitches are rare, affecting less than 1% of our trips ,\u201d Lineo said.\n\nSee also: N2,000 from VI to Egbeda: Drivers slam InDrive for offering \u2018ridiculous\u2019 fares\n\nHe said the company\u2019s system is designed to protect drivers by allowing them to avoid unfair trips and bid for more profitable ones. The company also ensures that negotiations between drivers and passengers are balanced, preventing unreasonably low or high bids.\n\n\u201cWe continuously monitor feedback and external factors impacting our service, striving to maintain a smooth and reliable experience for all users. We are committed to providing a fair and transparent platform for our drivers and passengers,\u201d the PR manager said.\n\nThe issue might be more serious than InDrive is admitting\n\nWhile InDrive\u2019s response is tenable, it does not do enough to assuage drivers who have had to repeatedly deal with the same problem. The affected drivers, even if they are a random one per cent, would love to believe that they matter.\n\nSome drivers have complained that the issue is getting worse by the day.\n\n\u201c Someone needs to sue InDrive because it is becoming worse every day. Somedays I don\u2019t even go out because of the ridiculous amount on the app. I only go out when I get offline. This is because it is of no use. If I venture on such a ridiculous trip, the entire money won\u2019t even be enough for fuel alone .\u201d Ola, a driver said.\n\nThe situation is prevalent enough for some drivers to ascribe it to passengers, a reasonable attribution given the harsh economic climate. A driver, Jeremiah penned a strongly-worded open letter on X where he demanded that InDrive stop giving passengers the power to make ridiculous bids on the app.\n\n\u201c Hello in drive, We wish to bring to your notice in case you are not in touch with our present situation in Nigeria and the current rise of goods and services. There is an increase in the price of fuel and also the cost of maintenance. Stop giving riders the power to make ridicule of our job to render this service. Drivers under this platform are rendering services moving your riders from one point to another safely ,\u201d Jeremiah said.\n\nThe tweet has since attracted more complaints from other drivers.\n\nAnother driver echoed the same sentiment, although he felt the passengers were only happy to further reduce their fares:\n\n\u201c There has been a recent observation about a ridiculous fare price you input on the App and also giving riders the bargaining power of their own to lower the fare price which eventually put the drivers in a position of no option. This is to let you know that if nothing is done about this as soon as possible, do note that other notable platforms will heed the request of drivers on their platform (s) and do the needful about their pricing .\u201d\n\nHopefully, InDrive will rectify the GPS anomaly.

Great Irish Pubs Florida Inc. is also included in the wrongful death lawsuit.\n\nWhile Disney does not own Raglan Road, it does own Disney Springs, the shopping and entertainment district where the restaurant is located. Disney leases out space in the district to other companies to operate their businesses. The original lawsuit also notes that Disney \u201chad control and/or right of control over the menu of food offered, the hiring and/or training of the wait staff, and the policies and procedures as it pertains to food allergies at Disney Springs restaurants.\u201d\n\nOn the Walt Disney World official website, a disclaimer regarding allergy-friendly requests is included at the bottom of menu pages, including that for Raglan Road\u2019s dinner menu:\n\nGuests must speak to a cast member about their allergy-friendly request.

Our plant-based menu items are made without animal meat, dairy, eggs and honey.\n\nThis news follows the reports of Disney seeking to dismiss the wrongful death lawsuit based on an arbitration waiver included in the terms and conditions for Disney+, as well as purchasing Walt Disney World tickets through the My Disney Resort app. Disney claims Piccolo reportedly agreed to the Disney+ terms in 2019 when he signed up for a one-month trial of the streaming service on his PlayStation console, and in September 2023 when he used the My Disney Experience app to purchase tickets to visit EPCOT. Tangsuan passed away before she and Piccolo could visit the park.\n\nDisney stated in their motion that it is \u201cimmaterial\u201d whether or not Piccolo actually reviewed the arbitration waiver in the terms he agreed to.\n\nAttorneys for Piccolo called the motion \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csurreal,\u201d and have urged the court to not enforce the agreement.\n\nThe original incident occurred on October 5, 2023. Tangsuan and Piccolo visited Raglan Road with Piccolo\u2019s mother, Jackie. Tangsuan informed the wait staff at the restaurant of her severe allergy to dairy and nuts and was \u201cunequivocally assured\u201d that the food would be allergen-free.\n\nTangsuan ordered vegetarian broccoli and corn fritters, a sea scallops appetizer, a vegan entree, and a side of onion rings. Piccolo returned to their hotel room after the meal, but Tangsuan and her mother-in-law remained at Disney Springs. Later that evening, Tangsuan suffered an acute allergic reaction in Planet Hollywood, where she had difficulty breathing and collapsed to the floor. She self-administered an EpiPen and was transported to a local hospital soon after, where she later died.\n\nA hearing has been scheduled on Disney\u2019s latest motion in the wrongful death lawsuit for October 2 in Orlando, Florida.

The directive, issued with the approval of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, comes in the wake of longstanding unresolved fraud cases and dissatisfaction with the response of these banks in addressing these issues.\n\nThe circular, signed by Finance Department Secretary Dr. PC Jaffer (Budget and Resources), clearly instructs all relevant entities to not only withdraw their deposits but also refrain from making any further deposit investments in these two banks. Deputy Chief Secretaries, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries across all departments have been tasked with ensuring compliance with this directive.\n\nA stringent deadline has been set for the completion of this process. The circular mandates that all withdrawn deposits be documented in a prescribed annexure, which must include confirmation of account closure details. These documents are to be submitted to the Finance Department by September 20, 2024.\n\nThis sweeping order is rooted in serious financial mismanagement and fraud cases involving these banks that have dragged on for over a decade. For instance, the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) had invested in a one-year fixed deposit with the Rajajinagar branch of PNB on September 14, 2011. The amount involved was significant, with one fixed deposit receipt amounting to Rs 12 crore and another to Rs 13 crore. While the Rs 13 crore deposit was encashed after the period expired, the other Rs 12 crore deposit has been embroiled in a fraud case allegedly perpetrated by bank officials. Despite numerous meetings and correspondences with the bank, the issue remains unresolved, and the case has languished in the courts for over 10 years.\n\nIn a similar case, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had deposited Rs 10 crore in a fixed deposit with the Avenue Road branch of the then State Bank of Mysore (which later merged with SBI) in August 2013. Before the deposit matured, bank officials allegedly adjusted the money against a loan taken by a private company using forged documents. Despite multiple attempts by the KSPCB to recover the funds through meetings and correspondence, the bank refused to refund the money. This case, too, remains mired in legal proceedings.\n\nThe gravity of these incidents has been underscored by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, where the Auditor General\u2019s reports and objections have been hotly debated. The decision to withdraw deposits, restrict future investments, and close accounts with SBI and PNB is seen as a direct outcome of these discussions, which are recorded in the PAC\u2019s meeting proceedings.\n\nThe circular highlights the government\u2019s position by stating that the immediate withdrawal of all deposits and investments made by state government departments and associated institutions in all branches of SBI and PNB is non-negotiable. Furthermore, no further deposits or investments shall be made in these banks.\n\nThe directive extends to all offices, public enterprises, corporations, boards, local bodies, universities, and other institutions under the administrative control of various government departments. These entities are instructed to close all deposits and accounts held in SBI and PNB branches. The details of these accounts, along with confirmation of their closure, must be submitted to the Deputy Secretary to Government, Budget and Resources Branch, Finance Department, by September 20, 2024.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:30:47+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://organiser.org/2024/08/15/252042/bharat/karnataka-government-orders-withdrawal-of-deposits-from-sbi-and-pnb-accounts-amid-fraud-allegations/", "source": {"domain": "organiser.org", "location": null}}, {"uri": "c79f3ee70590457892885d06f079997d", "title": "Vinicy Chan and Kiel Porter", "body": "XPO has revived a sale of its European transportation business, according to people familiar with the matter, almost two years since it last scrapped the attempt to divest the operation.", "publication_datetime": "2024-08-15T13:30:46+00:00", "lang": "en", "url": "https://www.ttnews.com/authors/vinicy-chan-and-kiel-porter", "source": {"domain": "ttnews.com", "location": null}}]
